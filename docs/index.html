<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><strong>Texas is no stranger to drought.</strong> (Waterdatafortexas.org, 2017)</p>
<p>Texas is the second-largest state in the United States with a total area of 268,596 sq. miles (Texasalmanac.com, 2017). Such a large embodiment with drought affected area is difficult to conceptualize without a visual representation. As a result, spatial and temporal visualization would improve information visibility on the intensity of the drought’s implication on the area throughout Texas. Hence, the purpose for this project is to demonstrate the severity and distribution of drought by visualizing U.S. Drought Monitor data.</p>
<p>Texas has experienced several droughts in recent decade, including the most recent and most severe drought that began in 2011. Its’ rapidly growing population increasingly demand for more water (Twdb.texas.gov, 2017). Adding to the severity, climate change has also intensified the spike in water requirements demanding an effective solution for state’s water situation (Epa.gov, 2017). The visualization will realize the temporal changes through annual series.</p>
<p>Lastly, two prevalent factors have identified that contributed to the dry phenomenon directly, which is temperature and precipitation (Geochange.er.usgs.gov, 2017). The feature question of which factor is more impactful will be attempted to be visually represented for knowledge discovery. The correlational statistics will be produced with the spread of drought area and compared. <br></p>

<p>In observance of the visualization of drought distribution in October 31 over the years, most of counties were abnormally dry. Four counties in northern Texas (Cottle, Foard, King and Knox), several counties in eastern Texas, and some counties in southern Texas were in moderate dry situation. Jim Hogg county is stil currently suffering from drought. Specific values can be observed by mouse over the relevant cell in the interactive map.</p>

<p>In comparison with temperature changing line, the precipitation’s trend line fluctuates in a volatile manner, suggesting that long term precipitation condition is not stable. Hence, it is likelier to suffer from dry seasons.</p>

<p>In observance of the line graph, Texas suffers from severe drought during 2011 to 2015. During that period, temperature changed acutely, and precipitation was less than average values over the years. As such, we can estimate that less precipitation from warmer temperature may also be the likely cause of drought during those years than temperature.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Drought is definitely a feature since seventeen years ago. The highly inverse correlation in precipitation and temperature can only mean that as the temperature grows warmer, the less precipitation that it will be. Water rationing is not a long term solution, and new water supply has to be evaluated. Proposals like building new desalination plant in Texas is viable, as Texas is an energy hub with highly efficient energy pricing.</p>
