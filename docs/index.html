<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Texas is no stranger to drought: the state has faced several droughts in recent decades, including the most recent and most severe drought that began in 2011.Texas has faced increasing demand for water to meet the needs of its rapidly growing population. Moreover, climate change has led to Texas experiencing an increase in drought events since 2011, which has intensified the need for an effect solution for state’s water situation. (Waterdatafortexas.org, 2017)</p>
<p>Texas is the second-largest state in the United States and the total area is 268,596 sq. miles (Texasalmanac.com, 2017) so that it is difficult to conceptualize the degree of drought without a visual representation. In particular, spatial and temporal visualization can improve our knowledge on the intensity of the drought’s implication on the area throughout Texas. For visualization, the manner of the exploratory focus should be clearly investigated, where factors causing drought range from “Temperature” to “Precipitation” will be analyzed.</p>
<p>Analysis on the relationships between factors of drought, and the spread of the drought area, will be investigated.</p>

<p>Observing the visualization of drought distribution in October 31, most of counties were in abnormally dry. Four counties in northern Texas (Cottle, Foard, King and Knox), several counties in eastern Texas, and some counties in southern Texas were in moderate dry situation. Jim Hogg county suffered in severe drought in this day. Specific value can be observed by hovering mouse over the relevant cell in the interactive map.</p>

<p>While observing the line graph, we can find that, Texas suffered severe drought during 2011 to 2015. In this period, temperature did not change acutely but precipitation was less than average values in other years. As such, we can guess that less precipitation may be the cause of drought since 2011. With stable temperature and less precipitation, there was few rainfall in this term, in other words, it would be more likely to be dry.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Drought is definitely a feature since seventeen years ago. The highly inverse correlation in precipitation and temperature can only mean that as the temperature grows warmer, the less precipitation that it will be. Water rationing is not a long term solution, and new water supply has to be evaluated. Proposals like building new desalination plant in Texas is viable, as Texas is an energy hub with high efficient energy pricing.</p>
