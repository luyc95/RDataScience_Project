# Introduction
Texas is no stranger to drought: the state has faced several droughts in recent decades, including the most recent and most severe drought that began in 2011.Texas has faced increasing demand for water to meet the needs of its rapidly growing population. Moreover, climate change has led to Texas experiencing an increase in drought events since 2011, which has intensified the need for an effect solution for state’s water situation. (Waterdatafortexas.org, 2017) 

Texas is the second-largest state in the United States and the total area is 268,596 sq. miles (Texasalmanac.com, 2017) so that it is difficult to conceptualize the degree of drought without a visual representation. In particular, spatial and temporal visualization can improve our knowledge on the intensity of the drought’s implication on the area throughout Texas. For visualization, the manner of the exploratory focus should be clearly investigated, where factors causing drought range from “Temperature” to “Precipitation” will be analyzed.

Analysis on the relationships between factors of drought, and the spread of the drought area, will be investigated.

## Data
1. Texas boundary shape file

The shape file was downloaded from [Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER database](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_cousub.html) and loaded by function readOGR.

```{r shpefile loads,fig.width=50,results='hide'}
# load texas shp file
shp <- readOGR(dsn=path.expand("data/bnd_tx/txdot-counties/txdot-2015-county-generalized_tx.shp"))
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
```

2. Drought severity classification data

Downloaded from [The National Drought Mitigation Center](http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu "United States Drought Monitor"). It is a weekly map that the data is calculated based on measurements of climatic, hydrologic and soil conditions as well as reported impacts and observations from contributors around the country.(USDM, 2017)

> States Department of Agriculture, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Map courtesy of NDMC-UNL</em>.</p>

Data ranged from January 5 2010 to November 28 2017, including dates and drought classification results. The classification system and its meaning are shown as below.
![optional caption text](img/classification.png)

```{r us drought monitor data loading, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#  us monitor data loading
tx_7y <- read.csv('data/tx_7y.csv')
tx_7y_1 <- read.csv('data/tx_7y.csv')
tx_1031 <- read.csv('data/tx_1031.csv')

# show the data table
datatable(data=tx_7y_1[,c(-2,-3,-9,-10,-11)],style = 'default',options = list(pageLength = 5,autoWidth = TRUE))
```

Unluckily, the drought index for each county by state can be downloaded just in single day, therefore, I chose the data released in October 31 as sample. 

3. Time-series data

Downloaded from [US Climate Division](Datasethttps://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/cgi-bin/data/timeseries/timeseries1.pl), including temperature, precipitation and Palmer Drought Severity Index(PDSI) from 2000 to October 2017. PDSI is a standardized index that spans -10 (dry) to +10 (wet) which uses available temperature and precipitation data to estimate relative dryness and it is a standardized index that spans -10 (dry) to +10 (wet).(PDSI, 2017)
These data are shown online just like text, hence I collected them with Excel and loaded with read.csv function.

```{r,message=FALSE,results='hide',warning=FALSE}
# data2 temp$precip data loading
min_mean <- read.csv('data/minmean.csv')
max_mean <- read.csv('data/maxmean.csv')
precip <- read.csv('data/precip.csv')
drought <- read.csv('data/drought.csv')
total <- read.csv('data/total.csv')

# show the data table
datatable(data = total,
          options = list(pageLength = 12),
          colnames = c('Month', 'Mean Temperature (C)', 'Precipitation (cm)', 'Palmer Drought Index'))

```
<br>

## Preprocessing

* Link shape file and drought classification data

```{r,message=FALSE}
tx <- as.data.frame(tx_1031)
shp@data = data.frame(shp@data, tx_1031[match(shp@data[["FIPS"]], tx_1031$FIPS),])

# link shapefile with datatable
shp2 <- fortify(shp)
shp$id <- row.names(shp)
shp2 <- left_join(shp2,shp@data,by="id")
```


* Convert character type into date type

```{r,message=FALSE}
# convert table and date formet 
as.data.frame(tx_7y)
tx_7y$ReleaseDate <- as.Date(as.character(tx_7y$ReleaseDate),format="%Y%m%d");
tx_7y[,c("y")] <- 100
```


* Projection and spatial polygon transformation of drought classification data

```{r data transformation,message=FALSE}
# Transform spatial polygon data frame 
shp_loglat <- spTransform(shp,CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))

D0 <- shp[shp@data$D0!=0,]
D0_loglat <- spTransform(D0, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))

D1 <- shp[shp@data$D1!=0,]
D1_loglat <- spTransform(D1, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))

D2 <- shp[shp@data$D2!=0,]
D2_loglat <- spTransform(D2, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))

```

* Time-series data transformation

    
    + Fahreheit to celsius _weathermetrics package_
```{r,message=FALSE}
# Temperature format transfromation
total$mean.temp <- fahrenheit.to.celsius(total$mean.temp,2)
```



    + Convert table into xts format
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
total[,c("temp_10")] <- total$mean.temp/10
total$X <- as.Date(as.yearmon(total$X))
time <- xts(total[, c(2,3)], order.by=total$X)
total$precip <- total$precip*2.54
```

# Results


## Visualization of drought 


### Drought Percent area in Texas from 2010 to 2017

By watching the chart of time-series U.S. Drought Monitor data for 7 years, we can find that the area of drought percent area was large since 2011 to 2016, however, the drought situation has been relieving during 2017.

```{r one-year percent area,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# chart of one-year drought percent area
ggplot(tx_7y, aes(x=ReleaseDate,D0,fill="D0"),color='black') + geom_area() + geom_area(aes(x = ReleaseDate,D1,fill="D1")) + geom_area(aes(x = ReleaseDate, D2,fill="D2")) + geom_area(aes(x = ReleaseDate, D3, fill="D3"))  + xlab("Year") + ylab("Percent Area") 
```

### Sptial distribution of drought in Texas in October 31 2017

Drought spatial distribution maps are shown as below.

```{r visualization the drought area with different drought degree,warning=FALSE}
# visualization the drought area in D1 degree_ moderate drought
g0 <- ggplot(data = shp2,aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group,fill=D0))+ geom_polygon() + coord_map() + scale_fill_gradient(low = 'white',high = 'red')

ggplot0<- g0+ theme(legend.position = "right") + theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank())

# visualization the drought area in D2 degree_ severe drought
g1 <- ggplot(data = shp2,aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group,fill=D1)) + geom_polygon() + coord_map() + scale_fill_gradient(low = 'white',high = 'red')

ggplot1 <- g1+ theme(legend.position = "right")+ theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank())

# visualization the drought area in D3 Extreme_ severe drought
g2 <- ggplot(data = shp2,aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group,fill=D2))+ geom_polygon() + coord_map() + scale_fill_gradient(low = 'white',high = 'red')

ggplot2 <- g2+ theme(legend.position = "right")+ theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank())

# build the three graph in one page
grid.arrange(ggplot0,ggplot1,ggplot2,nrow=1)  
```

Observing the visualization of drought distribution in October 31, most of counties were in abnormally dry. Four counties in northern Texas (Cottle, Foard, King and Knox), several counties in eastern Texas, and some counties in southern Texas were in moderate dry situation. Jim Hogg county suffered in severe drought in this day. Specific value can be observed by hovering mouse over the relevant cell in the interactive map.

```{r interactive map,message=FALSE}
# Use leaflet to visualize the drought distribution of each county 
leaflet(shp@bbox) %>%
  addTiles()%>%
    addPolygons(data=shp_loglat,
                weight = 1,
                color = "grey",
                fillColor = "grey",
                stroke = T,
                fillOpacity = 0.1)%>%
  addPolygons(data=D0_loglat,
              label=paste(D0_loglat$CNTY_NM," (D0 =",D0_loglat$D0,")"),
              weight = 2,
              color = "yellow",
              fillColor = "yellow",
              stroke = F,
              fillOpacity = 0.4)%>%
  addPolygons(data=D1_loglat,
              label=paste(D1_loglat$CNTY_NM," (D1 =",D1_loglat$D1,")"),
              weight = 3,
              color = "orange",
              fillColor = "orange",
              stroke = F,
              fillOpacity = 0.8)%>%
  addPolygons(data=D2_loglat,
              label=paste(D2_loglat$CNTY_NM," (D2 =",D2_loglat$D2,")"),
              weight = 4,
              color = "red",
              fillColor = "red",
              stroke = F,
              fillOpacity = 1)%>%
  addMiniMap()%>%
  frameWidget(height = 500)
```


## Analysis of causes

### Visualization of precipitation and temperature
```{r interactive data window,message=FALSE}
# Use dygraph to chart
dygraph(data = time,
        main = "Temperature and precipitation from 2000 to 2017 in Texas",
        height = 100) %>%
  dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c("2000-01-01", "2017-10-01"))%>%
  dyOptions(stackedGraph = TRUE) %>%
  frameWidget(height =500)
```
Compared with temperature changing line, precipitation's trend line fluctuates more dramatically, so that the long term precipitation condition is not very stable. Hence, it is more likely to be dry without steady raining.


## Relationship analysis 

```{r temp & drought,message=FALSE}
total%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=X))+
    geom_line(aes(y=Palmer.Drought.Index.Mean,col="grey"))+
  geom_line(aes(y=total$precip,col="blue"))+
  geom_line(aes(y=mean.temp,col="red"))+
   scale_color_discrete(name = "Legend", labels = c("Precipitation", "PDSI","Temperature"))
    
```

While observing the line graph, we can find that, Texas suffered severe drought during 2011 to 2015. In this period, temperature did not change acutely but precipitation was less than average values in other years. As such, we can guess that less precipitation may be the cause of drought since 2011. With stable temperature and less precipitation, there was few rainfall in this term, in other words, it would be more likely to be dry.

# Conclusion
Drought is definitely a feature since seventeen years ago. The highly inverse correlation in precipitation and temperature can only mean that as the temperature grows warmer, the less precipitation that it will be. Water rationing is not a long term solution, and new water supply has to be evaluated. Proposals like building new desalination plant in Texas is viable, as Texas is an energy hub with high efficient energy pricing.
