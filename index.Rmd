# Introduction
Texas is no stranger to drought: the state has faced several droughts in recent decades, including the most recent and most severe drought that began in 2011. Texas has faced increasing demand for water to meet the needs of its rapidly growing population. Moreover, climate change has led to Texas experiencing an increase in drought events since 2011, which has intensified the for an impactful solution for state’s water situation. 

Texas is the second-largest state in the United States and the total area is 696,241 square kilometers so that it is difficult to conceptualize the degree of drought without a visual representation. In particular, spatial and temporal visualization can improve our knowledge on the intensity of the drought’s implication on the area throughout Texas. For visualization, the manner of the exploratory focus should be clearly investigated, where factors causing drought range from “Temperature” to “Precipitation” will be analyzed.

Analysis on the relationships between factors of drought, and the spread of the drought area, will be investigated.


# Required packages and data

Please install and load the required packages first.

```{r package loading, message =FALSE,results='hide'}
# packages installment
library(rmarkdown)
library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)
library(rgdal)

```

The boundary shape file of Texas is one of TIGER products which was downloaded from Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER database.

```{r shpefile loads,fig.height=100,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# load texas shp file
shp <- readOGR(dsn=path.expand("data/bnd_tx/txdot-counties/txdot-2015-county-generalized_tx.shp"))
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
```

In this project, I utilized drought severity classification data downloaded from United States Drought Monitor (The National Drought Mitigation Center,2017). It is a weekly map that the data is calculated based on measurements of climatic, hydrologic and soil conditions as well as reported impacts and observations from contributors around the country. The time series data ranged from Janaury 5 2010 to November 28 2017, including dates and drought classification results. The classification index system and its meaning are shown as below.
![optional caption text](img/classification.png)

```{r us drought monitor data loading, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#  us monitor data loading
tx_7y <- read.csv('data/tx_7y.csv')
tx_7y_1 <- read.csv('data/tx_7y.csv')
tx_1031 <- read.csv('data/tx_1031.csv')
tx <- as.data.frame(tx_1031)
shp@data = data.frame(shp@data, tx_1031[match(shp@data[["FIPS"]], tx_1031$FIPS),])
# show the data table
datatable(data=tx_7y_1[,c(-2,-3,-9,-10,-11)],style = 'default',options = list(pageLength = 5,autoWidth = TRUE))
```

Unluckily, the drought index for each county by state can be downloaded just in single day, therefore, I choosed the data in October 31 as my sample. To tidy my data, I did the projection work and transformated them into spatial polygon. Moreover, I mapped these data to demonstrate the distribution of drought conditions.

```{r data transformation,message=FALSE}
# Transform spatial polygon data frame 
shp_loglat <- spTransform(shp,CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))

D0 <- shp[shp@data$D0!=0,]
D0_loglat <- spTransform(D0, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))

D1 <- shp[shp@data$D1!=0,]
D1_loglat <- spTransform(D1, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))

D2 <- shp[shp@data$D2!=0,]
D2_loglat <- spTransform(D2, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))

# link shapefile with datatable
shp2 <- fortify(shp)
shp$id <- row.names(shp)
shp2 <- left_join(shp2,shp@data,by="id")

```

Addtionally, I used the data downloaded from US Climate Division Dataset, including temperature, precipitation and Palmer Drought Severity Index from 2000 to October 2017. These data are shown online just like text, hence I collected them with Excel and loaded with read.csv function.

```{r}
# data2 temp$precip data loading
min_mean <- read.csv('data/minmean.csv')
max_mean <- read.csv('data/maxmean.csv')
precip <- read.csv('data/precip.csv')
drought <- read.csv('data/drought.csv')
total <- read.csv('data/total.csv')

# Temperature format transfromation
total$mean.temp <- fahrenheit.to.celsius(total$mean.temp,2)

# inch to cm
total$precip <- total$precip*2.54

# show the data table
datatable(data = total,
          options = list(pageLength = 12),
          colnames = c('Month', 'Mean Temperature (C)', 'Precipitation (cm)', 'Palmer Drought Index'))

```

# Results

## Visualization of drought 

### Drought Percent area in Texas from 2010 to 2017

By watching the chart of time-series U.S. Drought Monitor data for 7 years, we can find that the area of drought percent area was large from 2011 to 2016, addtionally, the drought situation is relieving during 2017.

```{r one-year percent area,warning=FALSE}
# convert table and date formet 
as.data.frame(tx_7y)
tx_7y$ReleaseDate <- as.Date(as.character(tx_7y$ReleaseDate),format="%Y%m%d");

# chart of one-year drought percent area
g <- ggplot(tx_7y, aes(ReleaseDate, tx_7y$D0),fill='black') + geom_area() + geom_area(aes(x = ReleaseDate, y=tx_7y$D1), fill='yellow') + geom_area(aes(x = ReleaseDate, y=tx_7y$D2), fill='orange') + geom_area(aes(x = ReleaseDate, y=tx_7y$D3), fill='red') + xlab("Year") + ylab("Percent Area") + scale_fill_continuous(guide = guide_legend())
```

### Sptial distribution of drought in Texas in October 31 2017

```{r visualization the drought area with different drought degree}

#ggplot0<- g0+ theme(legend.position = "right") + theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank())

# visualization the drought area in D2 degree_ severe drought
#g1 <- ggplot(data = shp2,aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group,fill=D1)) + geom_polygon() + coord_map() + scale_fill_gradient(low = 'white',high = 'red')

#ggplot1 <- g1+ theme(legend.position = "right")+ theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank())
